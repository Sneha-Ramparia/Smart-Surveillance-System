# Smart Surveillance System

An IoT-based home security system using **ESP32-CAM** for live face detection and real-time alerts via **Telegram**. With a simple Python GUI, users can start surveillance, manage known faces, and capture intruder footage â€” all from one desktop interface.

---

## How It Works

- ESP32-CAM streams live video over Wi-Fi.
- Face recognition detects known or unknown people.
- If an **unknown face** is detected:
  - It captures the image
  - Sends an alert with the photo to your **Telegram** chat
- A custom **Tkinter GUI** lets you:
  - Add/remove known users
  - Start/stop surveillance
  - View saved intruder images
  - Record activity manually
